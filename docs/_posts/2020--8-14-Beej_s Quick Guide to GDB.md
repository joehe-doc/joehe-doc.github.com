Beej's Quick Guide to GDB

_Release 2 (2009 Jun 14)_

This is a very quick-and-dirty guide meant to get you started with the GNU Debugger, **gdb**, from the command line in a terminal. Often times **gdb** is run via an IDE, but many people out there shun IDEs for a variety of reasons, and this tutorial is for you!

Again, this is only a getting-started guide. There's much much MUCH more to learn about what the debugger does than is written in these few short paragraphs. Check out your "man" pages or the online resources listed below for more info.

This tutorial is meant to be read in order, up to, but not including, the "Misc" section.

## Compiling

You have to tell your compiler to compile your code with symbolic debugging information included. Here's how to do it with **gcc**, with the **-g** switch:

$ **gcc -g hello.c -o hello**

$ **g++ -g hello.cpp -o hello**

Once you've done that, you should be able to view program listings in the debugger.

## More Information

Check out the [Official GDB Documentation](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/) for more information than you can shake a stick at!

Also, a good GNU GDB front-end is [DDD, the DataDisplayDebugger](http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/).

## Starting The Debugger

First things first: you can enter **help** at any **gdb** prompt and get more information. Also, you can enter **quit** to quit the debugger. Finally, just hitting **RETURN** will repeat the last command entered. Now let's fire it up!

There are several ways to start the debugger (e.g. if you were an IDE you might start it with a particular mode that's not so human-friendly) but I'll mention two of them here: vanilla console mode and curses GUI mode. The GUI is better, but let's quickly cover the simple one, and launch a program called **hello** in the debugger:
```
$ **gdb hello**
GNU gdb 6.8
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.  Type "show copying"
and "show warranty" for details.
This GDB was configured as "i486-slackware-linux"...
(gdb) **run**
Starting program: /home/beej/hello 
Hello, world!

Program exited normally.
(gdb) 
```
The last line is the **gdb** prompt, waiting for you to tell it what to do. Type **r** or **run** to run the program. (**gdb** allows you to abbreviate commands until they become ambiguous.)

**To start in neato and highly-recommended GUI mode**, start the debugger with **gdb -tui**. (For many of the examples, below, I show the output of **gdb**'s dumb terminal mode, but in real life I use TUI mode exclusively.)

And here is a screenshot of what you'll see, approximately:

![](../../_resources/1ddb7a2c901545368496f2e1265c79b5.png)

All the normal **gdb** commands will work in GUI mode, and additionally the arrow keys and pgup/pgdown keys will scroll the source window (when it has focus, which it does by default). Also, you can change which file or function is displayed in the source window by giving the command **list** with a location as an argument, for example, "**list hello.c:5** to bring up the file hello.c on line 5. (See "[Breakpoints](http://beej.us/guide/bggdb/#breakpoints)", below, for sample locations—the same locations that work with breakpoints will work with the **list** command.) As a side note, **list** also works in dumb terminal mode.

Now, notice that we passed the name of the executable on the command line. Another option you have is to just start **gdb** with nothing else on the command line, then give it the command **file hello**, and that will cause the executable "hello" to be loaded up.

Command line arguments! What if you have to get something into argv in your program? Pass them as arguments to the **run** command when you start execution:
```
$ **gdb hello**

(gdb) **run arg1 arg2**
Starting program: /home/beej/hello arg1 arg2
Hello, world!

Program exited normally.
(gdb) 
```

Notice where it says "Starting Program", above, it shows the arguments "arg1" and "arg2" being passed to "hello".

## Breakpoints

Just starting the debugger to run the program straight through isn't very useful—we need to stop execution and get into stepping mode.

First, before you issue the **run** command, you need to set a breakpoint someplace you'd like to stop. You use the **break** or **b** command, and specify a location, which can be a function name, a line number, or a source file and line number. These are examples of locations, which are used by various other commands as well as **break**:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **break main** | Break at the beginning of the main() function |
| **break 5** | Break at line 5 of the current file |
| **break hello.c:5** | Break at line 5 of hello.c |

So for this test, let's set a breakpoint at main(), and start the program:

```
$ **gdb hello**
GNU gdb 6.8
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.  Type "show copying"
and "show warranty" for details.
This GDB was configured as "i486-slackware-linux"...
(gdb) **b main**
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048395: file hello.c, line 5.
(gdb) **r**
Starting program: /home/beej/hello 

Breakpoint 1, main () at hello.c:5
5		printf("Hello, world!\\n");
(gdb)
```

As you see, we've arrived at main() and execution has stopped at the breakpoint we set there. If you're running in dumb terminal mode, **gdb** will print the line it will execute next. If you're running in cool GUI mode, the line it will execute next will be highlighted in the source window.

To list the current breakpoints, use the **info** command, like so: "**info breakpoints**" (or the shorter "**i b**"):

```
(gdb) **b main**
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048395: file hello.c, line 5.
(gdb) **i b**
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address    What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x08048395 in main at hello.c:5
```
To clear a breakpoint, use the **clear** command with the breakpoint location. You can also clear a breakpoint by number with the **delete** command.

Additionally, you can **enable** or **disable** breakpoints, though these two commands take a breakpoint number as an argument, not a location! The enabled/disabled status of a breakpoint is visible under the "Enb" column in the breakpoint listing.
```
(gdb) **i b**
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address    What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x08048395 in main at hello.c:5
(gdb) **disable 1**
(gdb) **i b**
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address    What
1       breakpoint     keep n   0x08048395 in main at hello.c:5
(gdb) **clear main**
Deleted breakpoint 1 
(gdb) **i b**
No breakpoints or watchpoints.
```
## Stepping Around

Once execution stops at a breakpoint, you can tell the debugger to do a few things. Let's start with the **next** command (or **n**). This command moves you to the next statement in the current function (or returns to the function's caller if you've stepped off the end of the function.) Here's a sample run; remember that **gdb** is printing the line _it will execute next_ just before the "(gdb)" prompt. Also notice that when we run **next** on the printf() line, we see the output appear.
```
(gdb) **b main**
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048395: file hello.c, line 5.
(gdb) **r**
Starting program: /home/beej/hello 

Breakpoint 1, main () at hello.c:5
5		printf("Hello, world!\\n");
(gdb) **next**
Hello, world!
7		return 0;
(gdb) **next**
8	}
(gdb) **next**
0xb7d6c6a5 in \_\_libc\_start_main () from /lib/libc.so.6
(gdb) **next**
Single stepping until exit from function \_\_libc\_start_main, 
which has no line number information.

Program exited normally.
(gdb) 
```

(That weird stuff at the end about \_\_libc\_start_main() shows you that there was another function that called your main() function! It wasn't compiled with debugging information so we can't see the source, but we can still step through it—which we do—and the program exits normally.)

Now, notice that **next** _steps over_ function calls. This doesn't mean that function doesn't get called; it means that **next** will execute the function until it's done, and then return you to the next line in your current function.

What if you have a function you want to _step into_ from your current function, and trace through that function line-by-line? Use the **step** (or **s**) command to do this. It works just like **next**, except it steps into functions.

Let's say you're tired of single stepping, and just want the program to run again. Use the **continue** (or **c**) command to continue execution.

What if the program is running but you forgot to set breakpoints? You can hit **CTRL-C** and that'll stop the program wherever it happens to be and return you to a "(gdb)" prompt. At that point, you could set up a proper breakpoint somewhere and **continue** to that breakpoint.

One final shortcut is that just hitting **RETURN** will repeat the last command entered; this will save you typing **next** over and over again.

## Examining Variables

If you have some variables you wish to inspect over the course of the run, you can **display** them, but only if the variable is currently in scope. Each time you step the code, the value of the variable will be displayed (if it's in scope).

(The following output is missing source code output between lines for clarity—it's what you'd see in GUI mode. Imagine you're seeing the highlight bar bouncing around the source code while you're running this:)

```c
(gdb) b main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048365: file hello.c, line 5.
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/beej/hello 

Breakpoint 1, main () at hello.c:5
(gdb) disp i
1: i = -1207447872
(gdb) **next**
1: i = 1
(gdb) **next**
1: i = 1
(gdb) **next**
1: i = 2
(gdb) **next**
1: i = 2
(gdb) **next**
1: i = 4
(gdb) **next**
1: i = 4
(gdb) **next**
1: i = 4
(gdb) 
```

The number to the left of "i", above, is the display number of the variable. Use this number to **undisplay** the variable. If you forget the display numbers, you can type **info display** to get them:

```
(gdb) **b main**
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048365: file hello.c, line 5.
(gdb) **r**
Starting program: /home/beej/hello 

Breakpoint 1, main () at hello.c:5
(gdb) **display i**
1: i = -1207447872
(gdb) **info display**
Auto-display expressions now in effect:
Num Enb Expression
1:   y  i
(gdb) **undisplay 1**
(gdb)
```
If you just want to one-off know the value of a variable, you can **print** it. Here we see the value of "i" is 40:

```
(gdb) **print i**
$1 = 40
(gdb)
```
(The "$" with the number after it means something, but it's not important for beginners.)

There's also a handy **printf** command that you can use to better format your output if you want to:
```
(gdb) **printf "%d\\n", i**
40
(gdb) **printf "%08X\\n", i**
00000028
(gdb)
```
## Misc Stuff

This is stuff that doesn't really fit in the earlier sections, but it fun enough to list somewhere.

### Stack Manipulation

The command **backtrace** (or **bt**) will show you the current function call stack, with the current function at the top, and the callers in order beneath it:
```
(gdb) **backtrace**
#0  subsubfunction () at hello.c:5
#1  0x080483a7 in subfunction () at hello.c:10
#2  0x080483cf in main () at hello.c:16
(gdb)
```
Type **help stack** for more info on what you can do with this.

### Additional Stepping Methods

To exit the current function and return to the calling function, use the **finish** command.

To step for a single assembly instruction, use the **stepi** command.

To continue to a specific location, use the **advance** command, specifying a location like those shown in the "[Breakpoints](http://beej.us/guide/bggdb/#breakpoints)" section, above. Here's an example which advances from the current location until the function subsubfunction() is called:
```
Breakpoint 1, main () at hello.c:15
15		printf("Hello, world!\\n");
(gdb) **advance subsubfunction**
Hello, world!
subsubfunction () at hello.c:5
5		printf("Deepest!\\n");
(gdb) 
```

**advance** is just shorthand for "continue to this temporary breakpoint."

### Jumping to an Arbitrary Section of Code

The **jump** command works exactly like **continue**, except it takes a location to jump to as an argument. (See the the "[Breakpoints](http://beej.us/guide/bggdb/#breakpoints)" section, above, for more information on locations.)

If you need to stop at the jump destination, set a breakpoint there first.

### Changing Variables and Values at Runtime

You can use the **set variable** command with an expression to evaluate, and this allows you to change the value of a variable during the run. You can also shorthand this by just using **set** with a parenthesized expression after it:
```
Breakpoint 1, main () at hello.c:15
15		int i = 10;
(gdb) **print i**
$1 = -1208234304
(gdb) **set (i = 20)**
(gdb) **print i**
$2 = 20
(gdb) **set variable i = 40**
(gdb) **print i**
$3 = 40
(gdb) 
```
This, along with the **jump** command, can help you repeat sections of code without restarting the program.

### Hardware Watchpoints

Hardware watchpoints are special breakpoints that will trigger whenever an expression changes. Often you just want to know when a variable changes (is written to), and for that you can use the **watch** command:
```
Breakpoint 1, main () at hello.c:5
5		int i = 1;
(gdb) **watch i**
Hardware watchpoint 2: i
(gdb) **continue**
Continuing.
Hardware watchpoint 2: i

Old value = -1208361280
New value = 2
main () at hello.c:7
7		while (i < 100) {
(gdb) **continue**
Continuing.
Hardware watchpoint 2: i

Old value = 2
New value = 3
main () at hello.c:7
7		while (i < 100) {
(gdb)
```
Note that **watch** takes an expression as an argument, so you can put a variable name in there, or something more complex like *(p+5) or a\[15\]. I've even tried it with conditional expressions like i > 10, but have had mixed results.

You can get a list of watch points with **info break** or **info watch**, and you can delete them by number with the **delete** command.

Finally, you can use **rwatch** to detect when a variable is read, and you can use **awatch** to detect when a variable is either read or written.

### Attach to a Running Process

If your program is already going and you want to stop it and debug, first you'll need the process ID (PID), which will be a number. (Get it from Unix's **ps** command.) Then you'll use the **attach** command with the PID to attach to (and break) the running program.

For this, you can just start **gdb** with no arguments.

In the following complete run, you'll notice a few things. First I attach to the running process, and it tells me it's in some function deep down called \_\_nanosleep\_nocancel(), which isn't too surprising since I called sleep() in my code. Indeed, asking for a **backtrace** shows exactly this call stack. So I say **finish** a couple times to get back up to main().

$1 = 19
(gdb) **quit**
The program is running.  Quit anyway (and detach it)? (y or n) **y**
Detaching from program: /home/beej/hello, process 3490
```

Notice that when I get back to main(), I print the value of i and it's 19—because in this case the program has been running for 19 seconds, and i gets incremented once per second.

Once we've quit the debugger and detached from the program, the program returns to running normally.

Mix this with **set variable**, above, and you've got some power!

### Using Coredumps for Postmortem Analysis

Let's say you build and run a program, and it dumps core on you for some reason or another:

$ **cc -g -o foo foo.c**
$ **./foo**
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

This means that a core file (with a memory snapshot from the time of the crash) has been created with the name "core". If you're not getting a core file (that is, it only says "Segmentation fault" and no core file is created), you might have your ulimit set too low; try typing **ulimit -c unlimited** at your shell prompt.

You can fire up **gdb** with the **-c** option to specify a core file:

$ **gdb -tui -c core foo**

And, if in TUI mode, you'll be greeted with a screen of information, telling you why the program exited ("signal 11, Segmentation fault"), and the highlight will be on the offending line. (In dumb terminal mode, the offending line is printed out.)

In this example, I print the variable that's causing the problem. Indeed it is NULL:

![](../../_resources/30bf49420cf44c118c44bcf244fea9f7.png)

Even if you don't have all the source code, it's often useful to get a **backtrace** from the point the program crashed.

## Window Functions

In TUI mode, you can get a list of existing windows with the **info win** command. You can then change which window has focus with the **focus** (or **fs**) command. **focus** takes either a window name, or "prev" or "next" as an argument. Valid window names are "SRC" (source window), "CMD" (command window), "REGS" (registers window), and "ASM" (assembly window). See the next section for how to use these other windows.

Note that when the SRC window has focus, the arrow keys will move the source code, but when the CMD window has focus, the arrow keys will select the previous and next commands in the command history. (For the record, the commands to move the SRC window single lines and single pages are **+**, **-**, **<**, and **>**.)
```
(gdb) **info win**
        SRC     (36 lines)  &lt;has focus&gt;
        CMD     (18 lines)
(gdb) **fs next**
Focus set to CMD window.
(gdb) **info win**
        SRC     (36 lines)
        CMD     (18 lines)  &lt;has focus&gt;
(gdb) **fs SRC**
Focus set to SRC window.
(gdb)
```
(Window names are case in-sensitive.)

The **winheight** (or **wh**) command sets the height of a particular window, but I've had bad luck with this working well.

### Display Registers and Assembly

In TUI mode, the **layout** command controls which windows you see. Additionally, the **tui reg** allows control of the register window, and will open it if it's not already open.

The commands are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **layout src** | Standard layout—source on top, command window on the bottom |
| **layout asm** | Just like the "src" layout, except it's an assembly window on top |
| **layout split** | Three windows: source on top, assembly in the middle, and command at the bottom |
| **layout reg** | Opens the register window on top of either source or assembly, whichever was opened last |
| **tui reg general** | Show the general registers |
| **tui reg float** | Show the floating point registers |
| **tui reg system** | Show the "system" registers |
| **tui reg next** | Show the next page of registers—this is important because there might be pages of registers that aren't in the "general", "float", or "system" sets |

Here's a nifty screenshot to whet your appetite, showing source and assembly in "split" mode:

![](../../_resources/eac5e198d8ff482d9abdb9bebfb8ff2f.png)

Assembly code comes in two flavors on Intel machines: Intel and AT&T. You can set which one appears in the disassembly window with **set disassembly-flavor**. Valid values are "intel" and "att". If you already have the assembly window open, you'll have to close it and reopen it (**layout src** followed by **layout split**, for example.)

To display registers in dumb terminal mode, type **info registers** for the integer registers, or **info all-registers** for everything.

### Writing a Front-End

You're thinking, "Wow, this is pretty cool, but I could write a killer front-end for this thing that worked so much better! How do I do it?"

GDB supports what it calls the "machine interface interpreter", or GDB/MI. The interpreter is selected on the **gdb** command line with the **--interpreter** switch.

Basically you'll launch **gdb** and read commands and results to and from it (probably using pipes). Pretty straightforward.

See the [GDB documentation for all the details](http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_26.html#SEC263).
